### Directory Explanations

- **`components/`** - Contains all reusable React components such as headers, cards, buttons, and layout components. Each component is self-contained and can be imported across different pages.

- **`interfaces/`** - Houses TypeScript interface definitions and type declarations. This ensures type safety throughout the application and provides better development experience with IntelliSense.

- **`constants/`** - Stores application-wide constants such as API endpoints, configuration values, default settings, and static data that doesn't change during runtime.

- **`public/assets/`** - Contains static files including images, icons, fonts, and other media assets that are served directly by the web server.
